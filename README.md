## High Concept Statement

  A freshly retired agent Virtus stumbles upon a secret conspiracy involving some of the most powerful people in the world. There he discovers that he must take up the mantle once more and work against his country, who now conspires with an enemy nation. In transit, his tracks were followed, and he was ambushed; resulting in his entire squadron being murdered. This is the story of a survivor, in his eyes a new fire of vengeance burns where righteousness once flared. His mission—to stop the delivery of this state-of-the-art armament system that will soon shake the very foundations of modern civilization. 

## PLAYER EXPERIENCE GOALS/DESIGN GOALS:

-	**Freedom of action** – The players are presented with problems that may come in the form of a puzzle or a challenge. The methods in which they solve this are up to the players and how they make use of the tools available.
-	**Subterfuge** – Sneaking by an enemy is not the only route to clearing stages; one can employ intelligence gathering through data logs that can give the player an advantage over a tough opponent. The player can also make use of their environment to create distractions. When all else fails—or if the player prefers, violence is always an option. However, it is not an easy path. Later in the game, the player will need to control two characters at exchange-ably, drastically increasing the amount of ways you can clear a stage.
-	**Strategic** – Various tools are made available to the player, such as the mini-map, weapons and inventory items to act with. The game will not rush the player, they can take all the time they need to formulate the best possible path to succeed, until they make their decision.
-	**Tension** – The combination of music, isolation and consequence of action is intended to evoke a feeling of tension in the player and caution them first to think before leaping to action, though either method of play is viable. Even as the second character is introduced, if the player acts irrationally, they will feel the effects of their mistakes as the more mistakes are made, the harder the next level becomes in the form of additional enemy spawns.
